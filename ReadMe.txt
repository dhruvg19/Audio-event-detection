'Model_Codes' folder contains the .ipynb code files of 5 different models - Linear, CNN, RNN, NN, GMM.

'Model_Weights' folder contains the respective model weights:
a) There are 3 GMM models - one for music, one for speech, one for silence. Each model has its own pi, mean and covariance matrices. These .npy files
   are stored in the folder GMM_Weights.
b) The W matrix of the linear model is stored in .npy format ('linear_weights.npy')
c) CNN, RNN and simple neural network models are stored in the form of .h5 files


Apart from the above two, the project report and the powerpoint presentation are also included.
